# ‚≠êÔ∏èOverview

In this file we prep the call logs that MDAC sends us to be uploaded into FM Pro.

**From Sunil, 2021-10-22:**

Hi Brad,

It was great meeting with you today! As we discussed, please see the attached Excel file which includes sample data from FileMaker, indicating the fields I would need from the M Davis call file. I‚Äôve indicated in __red__ the related field names that M Davis is using. I‚Äôll program the database to expect three separate files during the import process.

If there are any new fields you would like me to create in FileMaker (for example the duration of the call, M Davis field: CallDurationInSeconds) please provide these fields with a prefix (such as mdac_CallDurationSeconds). Let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of assistance. Feel to reach out over the weekend if something comes up when you are working on it.

Thanks and have a great weekend,
Sunil

Attached files are in the codebooks folder.

**From Sunil, 2021-10-27**

Hi Brad and Kristen,

The database is expecting three separate CSV files from the M Davis file. The first row should have field names. I can code it so that the database automatically matches the variable names up during import. The data will be imported into FileMaker tables PhoneRecruitment, CallLog, and ParticipantScheduler. Attached is an example of the data that the database is expecting to import in from the M Davis file. The first row contains the FileMaker field names and those in red are their corresponding fields from the M Davis file.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any assistance.

Thanks,
Sunil

###MocaOrientation

The "MocaOrientation" variable shown in the "M Davis Filemaker Required Fields" Microsoft Excel Sheet requires combining the results of variables "OR_DATE", "OR_DAY", and "OR_PLACECITY". "MocaOrientation" should be formatted as a character string using a combination of the words "Date", "Month", "Year", "Day", "Place", and "City", depending on the participant's success during the corresponding assessment.

To create "MocaOrientation", we can first alter the "OR_DATE" variable to display the word "Date" for participants who were successful in the assessment corresponding to "OR_DATE". We can do this by:

1. Creating a variable "datediff" that will display the numeric difference between the date the participant was called (ResLastCallDate) and the date the participant recalled (OR_DATE). Due to the format of both date variables, if the participant correctly recalled the date, "datediff" would contain a value of 0 for that observation. If the participant incorrectly recalled the date, "datediff" would contain a value greater or less than 0.

2. Substituting the word "Date" into the "OR_DATE" variable for participants whose "datediff" variable contains a value of 0.

```{r}
# For data checking
call_history %>% 
  select(resRespondent, ResLastCallDate, OR_DATE) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(OR_DATE))
```


```{r}
call_history <- call_history %>%
 mutate(datediff = (ResLastCallDate-OR_DATE)) %>% 
  mutate(OR_DATE = case_when(datediff == 0~'Date'))
```

Next, we can alter the "OR_DAY" variable to display the word "Day" for participants who were successful in the assessment corresponding to "OR_DAY". We can do this by:

1. Putting the "ResLastCallDate" into the Year/Month/Day format.

2. Creating a variable called "weekday" and filling it with the names of the weekdays corresponding to the dates in "ResLastCallDate".

3. Recoding "weekday" to match the formatting of the variable "OR_DAY". [Sunday = 1, Monday = 2, Tuesday = 3, Wednesday = 4, Thursday = 5, Friday = 6, Saturday = 7]

4. Recoding "OR_DAY" to display to display the word "Day" if the numeric value in the "OR_DAY" variable was equal to the numeric value in the "weekday" variable.

```{r}
call_history <- call_history %>% 
 mutate(ResLastCallDate = ymd(ResLastCallDate)) %>% 
  mutate(weekday = weekdays(ResLastCallDate)) %>% 
  mutate(weekday = recode(
    weekday,
    "Sunday" = "1",
    "Monday" = "2",
    "Tuesday" = "3",
    "Wednesday" = "4",
    "Thursday" = "5",
    "Friday" = "6",
    "Saturday" = "7")) %>% 
  mutate(OR_DAY = case_when(weekday == OR_DAY~"Day"
  )
)
```

Now we can create the "MocaOrientation" variable by combining "OR_DATE", "OR_DAY", and "OR_PLACECITY".

```{r}
call_history$MocaOrientation = paste(
  call_history$OR_DATE,
  ",",
  call_history$OR_DAY,
  ",",
  call_history$OR_PLACECITY
)
```

###AppointmentTime

In the "M Davis Filemaker Required Fields" Microsoft Excel Sheet, the "Participant Scheduler" sheet requires a variable "AppointmentTime" formatted as H:M:S, so we can create "AppointmentTime" to display the time in that manner.

```{r}
call_history$AppointmentTime <- format(as.POSIXct(
  call_history$SCHED_FLWUP, 
  "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", 
  tz = ""),
  format = "%H:%M"
)
```

###AppointmentDate

In the "M Davis Filemaker Required Fields" Microsoft Excel Sheet, the "Participant Scheduler" sheet requires a variable "AppointmentDate" formatted as month/day/year, so we can create "AppointmentDate" to display the date in that manner.

```{r}
call_history$AppointmentDate <- format(as.Date(
  call_history$SCHED_FLWUP,
  "%Y-%m-%d"), 
  format = "%m/%d/%Y"
)
```

###ResLastCallDate

MDAC codebook = Date of call "yyyyMMdd" format.

This variable contains the same information as EntryDate in FM Pro.

```{r}
call_history <- call_history %>% 
  mutate(ResLastCallDate_new = ymd(ResLastCallDate))

call_history <- call_history %>% 
  mutate(ResLastCallDate_new = format(
    as.Date(ResLastCallDate_new, '%Y-%m-%d'), "%m/%d/%Y")
  )

call_history$ResLastCallDate_new2<-call_history$ResLastCallDate_new
```

##Creating row count variable

For table Phone Recruitment, the database is expecting data from the most recent callattempt per participant.

```{r}
call_history <- call_history %>% group_by(PTCARERPTNUM) %>% 
  arrange(PTCARERPTNUM,ResLastCallDate,LastCallStartTime) %>%
  mutate(call_attempt = row_number())
```


##Grouping variables

Pulling the original FileMaker variables to their respective M Davis groupings (PhoneRecruitment, CallLog, and ParticipantScheduler) based on the expected file format laid out in the "M Davis Filemaker Required Fields" Microsoft Excel Sheet.

Note: the Phone Recruitment data frame requires only the most recent call attempt to be included.

```{r}
PhoneRecruitment <- call_history %>% filter(call_attempt == max(call_attempt)) %>%
  select(
  MOCA_SERIAL1,
  MOCA_SERIAL2,
  MOCA_SERIAL3,
  MOCA_SERIAL4,
  MOCA_SERIAL5,
  ResLastCallDate_new,

  MOCA_ABSTRAC,
  MOCA_DELREC,
  MocaOrientation,
  PH_ALZ_FLWUP,
  PH_BAT_FLWUP,
  PH_WNT_FLWUP,
  SCORE)

CallLog <- call_history  %>%  select(
  PTCARERPTNUM,
  ResLastCallDate_new,
  LastCallStartTime,
  resCodeResult)

ParticipantScheduler <- call_history  %>%  select(
  PTCARERPTNUM,
  AppointmentDate,
  AppointmentTime,
  ResIntervCall)
```
